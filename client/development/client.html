 In other words, since the client is a local file, there is no way to validate if its really coming from the client or someone is faking it, since there is no url that could be checked
so anyone can act as lithium chat
What about assigning each file an id stored in a cache file thats like. encrypted or some shit? so it verifys.
well doesnt it do that anyway after logging in? and im saying a device id. and like 0000000 is the client.

at that point we dont need a login page at all and can just store our tokens manually to the cache
there is no device id in browsers no like. the api reads the id sent. and it tells it if its a user or lithium
and like. or maybie read the ip? or smth? im designing something for the login screen. i am checking every now and then.
wel l the server cannot identify the cliin any way other that what the client sends themselves ohh...
maybie.... hmm.. pondering..... i mean there must be some way how do other clients do it???
like discord. or messenger???
 yeah it does. a EXE thats a file. 
so then why doesnt it say URL COULD NOT BE ACCESSED like with all the other iframes/webviews(android)
discord doesnt run on a local file :)
no, it doesnt.
the discord app is a copy of a chrome browser, it just loads discord.com
but its the same thing! an iframe is a browser that loads one link given to it.
even if it loads the site then why doesnt it show URL NOT FOUND. because ive tried to display things like that before
and it either says connection refused or url could not be accessed.
You are. your saying it uses a copy of chrome to display it
BUT HOW??? IT IS LITTERALLY A COPY OF A BROWSER??? SAME AS AN IFRAME?
im finna crash out. so then do an iframe. its secure right? so we use an iframe. you said its more secure by being more 
restrictive. so then use an iframe?
THATS WHAT WE WERE GONNA DO? Host a web page. and have a local file???
i wanted both because then if they blocked our page i would have a backup file. but i sttill wanted both?

because its not an iframe... it just load the site
no...
what do you mean by that, why would it say that
yeah because 90% of websites dont allow you to run them in an iframe
but who is saying that discord uses an iframe
discord uses a copy of chrome
iframe !== chrome
no, it is not...
i dont know where you heard that but it is not
an iframe element just loads a nested document
its kinda like a new tabpage
wym?

well at that point we can just host the client on a server
that would solvce all of that
you wanted a local file.. not me :)
if the
 block bthe domain it wouldnt work anyway since the site still needs to make a connection to the server even if its a local file
 not from what i can tell. i can still access gemini even though the sites blocked through butter
 what in thee nasa supercomputer is an endpoint???
 ohhhh. So then.
 fine
 lets just do a website and circle back to a local file later. when needed.
 

soo what now?

 but iframes are way more restricred than actual tabs, for security, since they are acessible by the parent 
 because they use a different endpoint for their api than their frontend.
 url to an API
 i can tell. so they make it hard on purpose?
 
 loging in on local files is complicated since its not usually recommended, since the server isnt able to verify where 
 the request is coming from
 its because if its a local file, the server doesnt know where the login is comming from, it could also be a hacker
 when it is from an URL, the server can see that and verify htaht its the real site  
 ohhhhhhhhh ok i get it now so a local file isnt a domain so it cant verify the code
 but a url is so it can tell and verify?
 im stupid :P so can we do a website wait
 can i test it in a little bit and can you add the code for logging in i gtg for a lil ill leave the LS open you
 can host it on my SSH if u want too. brb you can type and ill read when im back. ty for bearing with me while i
 acted stupid hehe

 yeah
 i guess ill just be copying it from here to my server manually
 okay sure
 np :) im back
 are your parents rich :^
why? :DD
 im wondering where you get all the money to do all this?
 domains cost alot. servers cost alot, compputers cost alot. and  you seem to have no problem doing it all *shrug*
 even more money *le gasp* its abuot 1020$ per year so not much *side eye*\
 so just like i know a really nice guy who gives me free server acess :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD *COUGH COUGH*
 still dodging the question. are your parents rich?
 really? Its a yes or a no. do you live in a nice house and have lots of funds or not. *i would be not* :DDDDDD\
 tf yall homesteaded?
 it means built a house/ become self sufficent  (grow gardens and use that for example)
 were luckky we have a house *skull* economy here is shitty. i would tell you my sob story but im not gonna make you feel bad
 dont wanna look like im using you because thats not nice and im not. besides its too long
 
for servers i know a guy who co-owns a datacentre, so he gives me really good prices lmao :D
no not really ig
i mean we got a house but my parents built it themselves so they didnt pay as much

what does that mean
sure we gow a garden but 
same here tbh
i mean we arent rich by any means
so you have a comfortable income? enough to survive with a little extra?

your income is like free because idk you dont really have any services that your offering to buy yet.
well yeah but thats 30 USD WAIT WHAT? CAN I HELP I DONT NEED PAYYMEENENNE
mama fucker.

i made 30$ yesterday for a website
and ive got a 100$ offer now
its for a tf2 trading bot. crypto is kinda shitty tbh. i dont make any money. i should start
and everybody who i offer to do smth for on discord they block me :(((((
is that softwarre? mama fucker. ooo. well maybie. but i was thinking more html and css design.
oh your right. its not blocked :DDDD
ill definitly look into it. i need to learn shaders is what i need. anyway we are so off topic its crazy
you can 
that thing i saw you doing with .frag you said it was bassically shaders.
is it worse than js
im not doing shaders :DDDDDDDDDDDD
dont even try to sell me it wont work >:[
not python *eye role* yes you cannn a basic I/O program :<

shaders?
uhhh, you will first need to learn coding with easier languages
glsl is a pain
10000%
JS is a very easy language
i mean it is, any other langauge is by far more difficult
python is not a proper langauage
its just for simple playing around but you cant make an actual program in it
a basic one yeah but nothing you could use in production

flask?
transfers python to HTML/CSS/JS


yeah, sure, as a proof of concept.
but in the real world, its not really used
since if it was, it would be very unpractical

technically you can run python in the browser itself
someone made a python engine in JS
but nobody uses that since it would be very slow and not practical
can we get back to coding the chat im bored ZZZZZ 
look i get bored very easy.
fine fine i get it. learn js and css and html and i can go somewhere. *sigh* ill try to learn but im not good at js
you sure? you seem like it xD
fair. so can you add it to your website after i finish making this.
i can, but only in codespaces. or ssh but i need vscode to code. not nano yeah no shit sherlock *eyeroll*
Your fucking telling me. i cant do shit crack on here. its SOOOO annoying ugh buttt my friend found an unblocked
game site HEHEHHEHEHEHHE so i cant WAIT to test that. not here.i cant use proxys. tried,does it have discord in the link?
they blocked the discord domain. fine lets try it.
 alr

bruh
im trying to help you with your coding , its that you wont get very far with python, and other languages are different
so if you wannt to get better youll need to start using "real" languages
then youll understand 90% of other langauges since they are all similar

how will it be synced?
hmm
well you can use ssh in vscode... if you had actual vscode
this sucks

wait you cant access dc rigile back for a similar reason
no, a custom one
no, i can choose a link
it looks like a different site but it loads discord
no not the domain, it proxies all discord requests through my sevrer

but its been a while idk what state is it in
ill try to find it
i made a discord proxy a whjil

guess what, i wasnt born a pro :)ourney
xD
it also took me a while, i am basically coding 24/7 for years
otherwise i would also suck
if i can tell you something straight upm

hmm
if you want to do design you should definitely learn to work with figma
yes used it together onece for some lios design
its where i also made the concept

its on the web and its free
you can use it without downloading


crap ive removed it from my backend
ill need to find it in github history and reimplement it

yay:)  alr
alr


wtf cant find it anywhere it must be a long time
but i got the proxy code atlest so thatkl work ill just add the handleri think we
but the payment is in LTC not direct cash
crypto u gud?

lukas?


i mean sure call it shitty but i just made a profit out of thin air XDD
i also dont rewally like it tho

<!-- 
The login link:
https://lstv.space/sso?app=41&ref=https://lithiumchaturl/&permissions=16
and the server auto recieves it if it works?
it redirects to a page
which i just realized may be an issue if you run it locally
yep. i think we need to have it redirect to a page that sends the login data to the client. like that post/smth system?
nononononono the local file listens to an online page where the api sends it too and if the local file sees that
the page recieved data it gets that data. so the local file just waits for the data.
it will listen to the server and uh. maybie...
idk your the networking whiz here. i just excel at design *shrug* :0
maybie a ws? or we can do my original idea with the api in the static file ? i know its risky but
only we will use static files right? and we dont need it to be a static file
i can also probably setup a socket system with python and use it as a backend if you can figure that out? except my computer
doesnt have pyuthon....
well it cant send data to a local file
but how will it know 
that would be too complicated, there must be an easier way

wait i got an idea
yeah i think it should work
if we open the login page in a new window that is controlled by the local file, it may be able to read the token directly
we can try ig
