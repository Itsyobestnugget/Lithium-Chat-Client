            <!--I GOT AN ERROR THE CONSOLE WORKS!!!! yay :) i got this: [CLIENT] Error: [object Event][SERVER] Connection Cut so we know it works. one thing tho.
            since i made the console seperate should we have a seperate js that JUST RELAYS Console logs to the page. so like. once
            we get a console message it sends it to console.js so that connection doesnt interfere because i think it ran
            when i loaded console.html. which is why it tried to connect and thus failed
            count console as a chat. display data there. like any normal user.
            nope i dont. im saying. display console as a user. thats blocked so you only recieve messages. it will
            show in chats not a seperate page. do you get me?
            brb and ill explain
            
            Ok so bassically the console will be known as a user. like you or me, but instead of us being able to send messages
            only the console will. we will be blocked from typing. but the console wont.

            So we wont be able to talk, but the console will exactly.
            But, why?
            well its so that its all in one page. itl be run by the js. and wont mess with other things. and we can
            make it type if we are gonna be able to send commands.
            huh
            like. stop. start. resstar. logs ect
            ...
            but the server isnt running on the client tho
            i am still not sure what you mean
            so you want to be able to acces the server form the client? yes well. only the logs. access logs from client as user. unless
            we add commands

            logs are handled by pm2
            technically i can make a separate log context and catch its messages and send them to the client
            so i guess its possible but not sure if it would be really too useful
            since the logs dont really show many interesting things
            but sure i can implement that, we just need to make sure that its handled securely so only we can access them yeah so that leads me here.
            we need to add a login. so that we can verify us or normal users along with a user ID and admin password for 
            added security.
        -->
        <!-- so something like a login link. more like a built in using your api. we can borrow discord token idea
         for that. like how it stores your token so it knows your signed in.
         yeah but do it built in. unless a link is easier ig.
         yeah that is what my api does?
         like a login popupp that sends data to your api and verifies ect ect. all in one ig.
         actually i know. because its sending data and that can be compromised.
         yeah lets do a link. and set that up.
         wdym by built in?
         okay i get that but that would be pretty unsecure
         the login should be done from the origin. so a link?

<!-- This is a html based client made for Lios, Oscario, and lstv devs. source code should not be used by others
     
    INDEV CHAT:
    Alr so heres our setup - Skip
    so how about you work on scripting ill work on html/css or we can do it all at the same time. ur choice - skip
    
    its a shortcut so you dont have to type it all manually each time - lukas

    i wasnt watching i was helping my brothers.
    home alone. with them. srry TwT - skip

    oh :D yeah that is fine - lukas

    srry 3: - skip
    so the JS will connect to the server if hosted once the page loads and then start?
        and all the rest will be stored on the server like chat history?
        i know the client. listen. im on my school laptop and cant access terminal so i need it to be on the html and start on loads
        

        i mean server things will be on the server
        but i am talking about the client, if you want it to be hosted on a server or jsut a static file- lukas
        it would be hosted on my server, no problem so then itl work?- skip
        no all i can do is open html and run codespaces. thats it, so i need a html css and js that runs on my computer
        without needing a terminal.- skip
        no i cant download anything on ChromeOS. they blocked linux functions and im only able to access github website
        so i need the files static on my computer. - skip
        
        i knew that. well not exactly. if we host a website on your server and keep a backup on my computer - skip
        
        ys
        
        i assume you cant use github desktop app right?
        
        can you sync local folders to github?
        
        okay, ill see if it is possible, but it will make some things a bit more difficult
        as the file:// protocol has much strictedr limitations

        Yeah but we cannot sync it.
        
        no but we can make a profile and both have access. i can use codespaces to access
        a github made terminal. but its limitid time. i am hoping to get a laptop soon if not im going\
        to get a job and make money for one. - skip
        
        allright :) - lukas
        so we need the js to connect to the server. retrieve data. and allow us to chat. on BOTH Static and online. and the extension cant be IO and the link cant contain Discord

laoocakllal
        If its static means that its going to run by opening the html file from a f olderr
        If its hosted that means we can use extra features and it will be hosted ona serve
